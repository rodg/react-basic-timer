# React Basic Timer
This is an example of how to setup a basic react nodecg bundle. Comes with dockerfile for running and testing the bundle.

## Install
For development it is helpful to run with `npm start` to have hot reloading.
```bash
npm install --force
npm start
```
Build and start nodecg containers with:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The nodecg dashboard should then be available at `http://localhost:9090`
